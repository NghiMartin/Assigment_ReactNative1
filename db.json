Robusta beans are typically considered to be hardier because they can grow at lower altitudes and resist diseases. But recent research suggests that they don’t handle heat as well as was previously thought.",

These tasty beans originated many centuries ago in the highlands of Ethiopia, and may even be the first coffee beans ever consumed!
